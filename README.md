# validator
Small utility to test a propositional logic theorem prover with randomly created valid and not satisfiable formulas 

##How to use it
Clone the git and move the .sh script with the bin folder into the folder where your theorem prover is.  
Rename the theorem prover executable: 
    
    prover
    
Run the .sh script with: 

    sh validator.sh
    
##NB
Right now this small utility can only run on linux, but I'm planning to release executable for macOS and Windows in the nearly future,
if you don't want to wait you can compile your own executable with Rust.
