# validator
Small utility to test a propositional logic theorem prover with randomly created valid and not satisfiable formulas 

## How to use it
Clone the git and move the .sh script with the bin folder into the folder where your theorem prover is.  
Rename the theorem prover executable: 
    
    prover
    
Run the .sh script with: 

    sh validator.sh
    
## NB
Now this works on macOS too, thanks to Sadir!
If you are on windows, you may want to compile it yourself (if you do, please send me the compiled files, so that I can upload them here!).
